# Security Audit Report - RefactorForge Repository

**Generated:** October 01, 2025
**Severity Summary:** 12 vulnerabilities detected (6 High, 6 Moderate, 0 Critical)
**Location:** Frontend application only (Backend is clean)

## Executive Summary

The RefactorForge repository has **12 security vulnerabilities**, all located in the **frontend application**. The backend is completely clean with no detected vulnerabilities. The issues are primarily related to transitive dependencies introduced by `react-scripts` (Create React App) and `react-syntax-highlighter`.

### Key Findings:
- **All vulnerabilities are in the frontend** development/build dependencies
- **No production runtime vulnerabilities** in the backend API
- Most vulnerabilities are related to development tooling
- Fixes require major version updates that may introduce breaking changes

## Vulnerability Details

### 1. HIGH SEVERITY: Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check
**CVE:** GHSA-rp65-9cf3-cjxr
**Package:** nth-check < 2.0.1
**Severity:** HIGH
**CVSS Score:** 7.5
**Attack Vector:** Network exploitable ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)

**Impact:**
- Can cause application DoS through crafted CSS selectors
- Affects build-time SVG optimization process
- Could slow down or crash build processes

**Dependency Chain:**
```
react-scripts@5.0.1
└── @svgr/webpack
    └── @svgr/plugin-svgo
        └── svgo@1.3.2
            └── css-select
                └── nth-check (vulnerable)
```

**Recommendation:** This is a build-time vulnerability, not runtime. Low actual risk for production.

### 2. MODERATE SEVERITY: PostCSS Line Return Parsing Error (x3 instances)
**CVE:** GHSA-7fh5-64p2-3v2j
**Package:** postcss < 8.4.31
**Severity:** MODERATE
**CVSS Score:** 5.3

**Impact:**
- Incorrect parsing of CSS could lead to style injection
- Primarily affects build process
- Could potentially allow CSS injection attacks during development

**Dependency Chain:**
```
react-scripts@5.0.1
└── resolve-url-loader@4.0.0
    └── postcss (vulnerable)
```

**Recommendation:** Update postcss to >= 8.4.31. This is a build tool vulnerability with minimal production impact.

---

### 3. MODERATE SEVERITY: PrismJS DOM Clobbering
**CVE:** GHSA-x7hr-w5r2-h6wg
**Package:** prismjs < 1.30.0
**Severity:** MODERATE
**CVSS Score:** 6.1

**Impact:**
- DOM Clobbering vulnerability in syntax highlighting
- Could allow XSS attacks if untrusted code is highlighted
- **PRODUCTION IMPACT:** This affects runtime code display

**Dependency Chain:**
```
react-syntax-highlighter@15.6.6
└── refractor
    └── prismjs (vulnerable)
```

**Recommendation:** **CRITICAL TO FIX** - This is a runtime vulnerability that could allow XSS attacks.

---

### 4. MODERATE SEVERITY: webpack-dev-server Source Code Exposure (x2 instances)
**CVE:** GHSA-9jgg-88mc-972h, GHSA-4v9v-hfq4-rm2v
**Package:** webpack-dev-server <= 5.2.0 (currently using 4.15.2)
**Severity:** MODERATE
**CVSS Score:** 5.9

**Impact:**
- Source code may be exposed when accessing malicious websites during development
- Only affects developers during local development
- No production impact

**Dependency Chain:**
```
react-scripts@5.0.1
└── webpack-dev-server@4.15.2 (vulnerable)
```

**Recommendation:** Development-only vulnerability. Educate developers about the risk.

## Risk Assessment

### Production Risk Matrix

| Component | Vulnerability Count | Production Risk | Development Risk |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Backend API | 0 | None | None |
| Frontend Runtime | 1 (PrismJS) | **HIGH** | HIGH |
| Frontend Build Tools | 11 | None | MODERATE |
| Overall | 12 | **MODERATE** | HIGH |

### Actual vs Reported Severity

While GitHub reports 6 HIGH and 6 MODERATE vulnerabilities, the actual production risk is lower:

1. **TRUE PRODUCTION RISKS (1 vulnerability):**
   - PrismJS DOM Clobbering (XSS potential) - **REQUIRES IMMEDIATE FIX**

2. **DEVELOPMENT-ONLY RISKS (11 vulnerabilities):**
   - nth-check ReDoS (build-time only)
   - PostCSS parsing (build-time only)
   - webpack-dev-server exposure (development only)

## Security Recommendations

### Priority 1: IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Production Security)
```bash
# Fix the PrismJS vulnerability
cd frontend
npm update react-syntax-highlighter --save
# Or consider switching to a different syntax highlighter
```

### Priority 2: SHORT-TERM ACTIONS (Build Security)
```bash
# Update react-scripts to latest version
cd frontend
npm update react-scripts --save
# This may require testing for breaking changes
```

### Priority 3: LONG-TERM ACTIONS (Architecture)
1. **Consider ejecting from Create React App** to have direct control over dependencies
2. **Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline**
3. **Use npm audit in pre-commit hooks**
4. **Regular dependency updates schedule** (monthly)

## Mitigation Strategies

### For PrismJS (CRITICAL):
```javascript
// Add input sanitization before syntax highlighting
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const sanitizedCode = DOMPurify.sanitize(userCode, {
  ALLOWED_TAGS: [],
  ALLOWED_ATTR: []
});
```

### For Development Vulnerabilities:
1. **Developer Education:** Inform team about webpack-dev-server risks
2. **Network Isolation:** Use VPN/firewall during development
3. **Regular Updates:** Schedule monthly dependency updates
4. **Automated Scanning:** Add GitHub Dependabot configuration

## Dependabot Configuration

Create `.github/dependabot.yml`:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/frontend"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "your-github-username"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"

  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/backend"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
    reviewers:
      - "your-github-username"
    labels:
      - "dependencies"
      - "security"
```

## Security Headers Configuration

Add to backend Express server:
```javascript
// backend/src/index.ts
import helmet from 'helmet';

app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"], // Required for React
      scriptSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"],
    },
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

## Testing Security Fixes

```bash
# After implementing fixes, verify:
cd frontend && npm audit
cd ../backend && npm audit

# Test for XSS vulnerability fix
# Create a test case for PrismJS
echo 'Test XSS: <img src=x onerror=alert(1)>' | npm test -- --grep="syntax highlighting"
```

## Compliance Notes

- **OWASP Top 10 Coverage:**
  - A03:2021 - Injection (PrismJS XSS vulnerability)
  - A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components (all listed vulnerabilities)
  - A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration (missing security headers)

## Conclusion

While the repository shows 12 vulnerabilities, only **1 poses a real production security risk** (PrismJS). The remaining 11 are development/build-time vulnerabilities with no production impact.

**Immediate action required:**
1. Update or replace `react-syntax-highlighter` to fix PrismJS vulnerability
2. Implement input sanitization for any user-provided code
3. Add security headers to the backend API

The backend is secure with no vulnerabilities, demonstrating good dependency management. Focus remediation efforts on the frontend's runtime dependencies.
