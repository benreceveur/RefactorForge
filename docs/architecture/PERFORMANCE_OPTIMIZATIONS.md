const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath);
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
```

**After**: Non-blocking concurrent operations
```javascript  
// NEW: Non-blocking with controlled concurrency
const content = await this.streamProcessor.processLargeFile(filePath, processor);
await this.concurrencyLimiter(operation);
```

### 2. Memory Management

**Before**: Loading entire files into memory
```javascript
// OLD: Memory inefficient
const allFiles = await Promise.all(files.map(file => loadEntireFile(file)));
```

**After**: Streaming with memory pressure monitoring
```javascript
// NEW: Memory efficient streaming
await this.streamProcessor.processFileStream(filePath, {
  chunkSize: 64 * 1024,
  memoryThreshold: 200 * 1024 * 1024
});
```

### 3. Database Operations

**Before**: Individual queries with no connection reuse
```javascript
// OLD: No connection pooling
const result = await db.get(query, params);
```
